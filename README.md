# spotify-track-analysis
## Project Description
This project seeks to use Tableau as a tool for the exploratory data analysis of Spotify song tracks. Using the development of data visualisations and dashboards, the project aims to extract hidden insights from the Spotify dataset such as what makes a track popular on Spotify.

The Spotify track dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset. The dataset has a good number of categorical variables such as the 'artists' and 'track_genre', and a slightly greater number of quantitative variables which are descriptive statistics of the tracks such as 'popularity' and 'tempo'.

2 dashboards are built for this project. One dashboard summarises the categorical variables like artists, albums, tracks, genre etc. The other dashboard summarises the factors that affect a Spotify track's popularity, which will then help us to predict the popularity of new tracks. It is noteworthy that this project can be expanded by exploring the dataset further in-depth to find more useful insights.

Topics covered in this project are:
- Data Visualisation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
